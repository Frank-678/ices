"Feb 18, 2025","10","Agusp18","es un juego que todo el mundo deberia probar, los recuerdos de jugarlo en la 1.4 y seguir disfrutando con las nuevas actualizaciones de vez en cuando hacen que sea un juego infinito"
"Nov 8, 2025","10","Zadh","buen juego para explotar tu creatividad, y tiene muy buenas colaboraciones como poppy playtime mega man mario y mucho mas"
"Nov 1, 2025","10","Sandushki","I have a lot of fun playing Minecraft almost all the time. My friends like it, too. Also, its large player community with a lot of different areas make it a very diverse game with endless possibilities, and new inventions from the community keeps on coming, which also improves gameplay. Although there are some bugs and glitches in the game, it is very well-made and accurate in my opinion. It is totally worth its price."
"Oct 23, 2025","9","Einheitlich8k","I don't know where to start: The game is just perfect, I've played it for more than 2khrs+ and im still not bored. First: The procedural generated world feels awgsome, C418s music just makes a special atmosphere that is just clearing everything bad from ure mind and combined with the amazing and easy to remember sound design, you need to try it yourself. The progression is perfect too, fast(if you know what ure doing), satisfying(due to the sounds) and You always have something to do in this game, legt it be pvp, building or exploring it always makes fun and everytime you play the game you get better at it and its unique mechanics Multiplayer is great too, It feels smooth, players are active, and playing wih your friends on a smp is just peak live fealing, you can even easily play with mods together. Modding: The game has many great mods and modders as well as useful mod managers that make moddin this Game so easy. There are many other things to talk about, and just everything is great(except the bedrock marketplace(for real dontbuy anything there, jusg buy java)) but im tired since ist 2 and i have no motivation anymore and yeah, just know: its the best game ever made, you can complain about scnd places for eg.: RDR2(Valid), Eldenring(Overrated) or GTA V(especially with friends) but just dont let these games disturb your mind Minecraft is #1 no complainings allowed."
"Oct 22, 2025","10","TheSpruceC","I've been playing this game for 10yearsit's the first game I ever played And i love it to this day. Carried my childhood thank youMojang!"
"Oct 14, 2025","10","AlexPlays","I've played this game on almost every platform possible, for over 10 years. It's great in singleplayer, but even better in multiplayer. You can have fun with the base game in vanilla or with mods, regardless of your age. It's the game that I have the most memories with and I think that every gamer should have played it at least once. Only thing that I don't really like is the Marketplace on Bedrock Edition, since most add-ons are paid."
"Sep 24, 2025","10","Danyil_Moroz","Year after year, this game never gets old, and year after year, it still manages to surprise. It surprises with its simplicity and the way it always welcomes you back as if it’s the very first time. No matter what criticism it gets, it remains one of the best games in terms of replayability. An incredible sandbox where every time you can set yourself a new goal - whether it’s exploring the world, building a city, or just playing with friends."
"Oct 6, 2025","10","memktdm","One of GOATs at history. Completely good. Always something to learn. Friendly users"

"Sep 22, 2025","10","mimitoplayer","Fue el primer videojuego que jugué en mi vida ace 6 años, pero tengo que admitir que en esos tiempos era mejor en esos tiempos y personalmente me gustaban mas la texturas de antes."
"Sep 15, 2025","9","MirandaLind","It’s a great game, you can express yourself easily in 3D blocks. You can choose to have infinite resources, or survive the monsters in the night. Definetly worth the money it cost me. Really hate that bedrock edition needs extra money to get mods tho. Otherwise, Java edition is absolutely perfect."
"Sep 15, 2025","10","Renexdsoypro","Minecraft es unbello juego tiene musicarelajante cuandoconsigues algo que es dificil de encontrar es como ganar una copa. Los graficos claramente no son buenos pero asi es el estilo de minecraft y si estas en pc le puedes poner shaders pero tu pc tiene que ser potente para que aguante. Las actualizaciones son buenas lo malo es que son 2 minecraft bedrock y java y los de movil no pueden jugar Java solo bedrock por eso tienes que rezar que un amigo de pc tenga la version bedrock pero al final el juego es bello."
"Sep 13, 2025","10","VodaAusSoda","My whole childhood in one game. Does it even need explanation? The only thing that bothers me nowadays, is how slow Mojang releases updated, while the community does such an amazing work."
"Sep 10, 2025","10","klyverpaulll","o melhor jogo que jguei na minha vida, atualização para os graficos deixou o jogo mais bonito"
"Sep 7, 2025","8","DSR_Reviews","Great game without a doubt but it quicky gets boring (especially without mods and friends)."

"Sep 1, 2025","9","MorganRob","If we’re raking the base version of Minecraft, this review would be a 7, bit the best part of this game is the potential for modding."
"Aug 31, 2025","8","CuckleDuckle","Every now and then, I load up MC, play for like 2 weeks straight, then don't play for another 9 months. It's like giving birth in a way."
"Aug 30, 2025","10","kutx","Neresinden başlasam ki bu oyunun. Müthiş açık dünyası mı, sizin yaratıcılığınıza bıraktıkları mı? Bilmem. Fakat şunu bilirim ki minecraft'a kötü diyen her insan yargılanmalı. Çoğu oyuncu oyunun şu zamanlarda kötüye gittiğini ve güncellemelerin gereksiz olduğunu söylüyor. Fakat bence oyuncular dışlarından böyle söylese de zaman geçtikçe güncellemelerin güzel olduklarını herkes anlıyor. Bunun dışında oyuna kötü denebilecek herhangi bir yan yok. Kafayı kırmış birisi değilseniz oyunun açık dünyasını bitiremezsiniz. Ve gelen güncellemeler sayesinde oyun içindeki her seyahatinizde sizi bir sürü farklı dost canlısı ve dost canlısı olmayan varlık karşılıyor. Siz de kafanıza göre onlar ile etkileşime girebiliyorsunuz. Her neyse ben neden kendimi açıklamaya çalışıyorum ki? Bahsettiğimiz oyun Minecraft sonuçta. Mükemmel deyip geçeriz ve kimse sorgulamaz. (Bunu okuyorsanız şuan gidin ve bir minecraft dünyası açın. Gününüz daha da iyi olacaktır.)"

"Aug 26, 2025","10","MimicTheShadows","This is my favorite game of all time so I have quite a bit to say about it but I don’t think my praise could ever express the love I have for this game. I’ve played this game for over half of my life and it’s been with me through so many ups and downs. No matter what happens in my life or how much it may ****, this game was always there for me. I will probably continue to play this amazing game until the day I’m in the grave. The amount of content is staggering. I don’t care what people may say about the updates. While this game is perfect in my eyes, it relies on intrinsic motivation more than any other game so if you want a set goal, this isn’t for you. 11/10 would recommend"

"Aug 16, 2025","9","davidcbascihlc","There is little to say about this game that hasn't been declared already. A constant through highs and lows, my life has, since its meek beginnings, been intertwined with this ambrosial delight **** experience. Some days I find myself creating gadgets and tools out of various items I find laying about, likening myself to the titular character. This game is an essential toe-dipper for any a gamer or otherwise. For what is a man; what has he got? If not Minecraft, then he has naught."

"Aug 15, 2025","10","LJP73","Minecraft is a perfect game, and arguably the greatest ever made, simply because it is whatever you make of it. You don't need this review, you know Minecraft."
"Aug 15, 2025","10","Damel","I’ve been playing Minecraft for years, and I can already say it’s not just a game — it’s a place. What I love is that it doesn’t tell you what to do. It hands you a world, infinite and untouched, and simply says: “Go.” From there, you decide whether to build, explore, fight, or just watch the sun rise over a blocky horizon. Minecraft doesn’t need a set story because the story is yours. Every block you place, every cave you explore, every base you build with friends — these are chapters you write yourself. And the memories you create aren’t scripted cutscenes; they’re real moments you lived in that world. What’s amazing is that the game isn’t “realistic” at all, yet it feels more alive than most games. That first night you spent hiding from zombies. The first diamond you found after hours of mining. The time you fell into lava with all your gear and just stared at the screen in shock. These moments become personal legends you never forget. And the music… those calm, melancholic piano notes that play when you’re mining or building alone at night — they don’t just fill the silence, they become the silence. They turn an empty, pixelated world into somewhere that feels safe, familiar, and strangely nostalgic, even the very first time you hear them. Minecraft is a game that stays with you because it’s not about beating levels or completing objectives. It’s about living in a world that’s yours — a world you shape, break, and rebuild. Long after you log out, it remains there, waiting for you to come back, like an old friend you know will never change, yet always surprise you."

"Aug 13, 2025","0","Ilves15","I must say that minecraft is somewhat fun, but it actually gets EXTREMELY boring after few hours/weeks. I think that most of you (both critics and users) are glazing this waaaay too much. You need to understand that the game isn't actually that special and the code ****. Like this is literally a pile of sand that stays in place with spaghetti."
"Aug 12, 2025","7","eidm","Honestly a good game but sometimes I have an absolute blast playing but sometimes it’s boring and i hate stupid creepers blowing up my hous. So a good game"

"Aug 2, 2025","10","DosluQ","Minecraft, sadece bir oyun değil, aynı zamanda sonsuz bir hayal gücü alanı. İlk oynadığınız an sizi hemen içine çeken, keşfetmeye ve üretmeye teşvik eden bir yapısı var. Birçok kişi için çocukluk anılarını canlandırması da onu özel kılıyor. İster devasa kaleler inşa edin, ister mağaralara dalın ya da basit bir köy hayatı yaşayın... Seçenekler gerçekten sınırsız. Ancak bu sınırsızlık bazen ters de tepebiliyor. Eğer kendinize bir hedef belirlemezseniz ya da ne yapmak istediğinizi bulamazsanız, oyun belirli bir süre sonra sıkıcı hale gelebilir. Minecraft’tan alınacak keyif tamamen oyuncunun hayal gücüne ve motivasyonuna bağlı."
"Aug 2, 2025","10","Antuan_LG","El mejor juego que existe, sin lugar a dudas, tiene todo, originalidad, gráficos decentes, mods, multijugador, creatividad en un solo juego, y desde cualquier dispositivo... Gracias"
"Jul 31, 2025","10","xXcathXx","java edition = lots of possibilities and if you get bored there's a 99% chance you'll come back after a few weeks or to play with friends. I don't know what else to say here, you can do literally anything Bedrock edition = ehhhhh.. the game is really buggy on windows like sometimes the chunk I'm standing on turns invisible for a second and it scares the sh out of me. The monetisation is just crazy and the mods on the marketplace are just resource packs you can get on Java for FREE. I said resource packs because you can replicate the exact same effect these bedrock 'mods' give on a vanilla java client with a texture pack Honorable mention - C418's music is incredible. I don't like the new sound tracks, most of the time they are **** when I'm in menu"

"Jun 8, 2025","10","Aguiar0601","Minecraft is pure freedom in pixel form. No rules. No path. Just you, a pickaxe, and a world that begs to be built, broken, and dreamed into existence. It’s a sandbox, a canvas, a playground for every kind of mind.There’s no story — you create it. No end — you choose it. That’s what makes it timeless.10/10. Because how do you rate a universe?"
"Jun 7, 2025","7","MissedZombie","Minecraft does a lot right, such as its sandbox and creative side, but it gets a bit repetitive once you step into the survival aspect. There is a lot of replayability here, but that point of replaying can be reached quite quick. The act of getting wood, getting ores, and beating the ender dragon is really not as entertaining as it once was, and the newer updates are not helping since the game was in a state where it could have been left about 7 years ago."

"Apr 6, 2025","0","mickrussom","Minecraft 2025 is a colossal misfire that makes you wonder how anyone could fumble a property as endlessly creative as Minecraft this badly especially when Super Mario proved video game adaptations can be vibrant, fun, and worth watching. Instead of a blocky wonderland bursting with imagination, we get a soulless, corporate cash-grab that's as uninspired as a dirt hut built by a first-day player. And at the center of this mess is Jack Black, whose over-the-top shtick as Steve feels less like a character and more like a bloated, annoying caricature of himself phoning it in with the energy **** who ate too many pork chops and forgot what made his Bowser a good character.Where Super Mario delivered a tight, colorful romp with a villain you couldn't help but like to hate, Minecraft stumbles through a plot so thin it could've been scribbled on a 3x5 card with a fat sharpie. The live action gimmick is a disaster with corpulent Jack Black waddling around in a turquoise shirt against a green screen looks less like an adventure and more like a sad clown act at a kid's party no one showed up to. His constant mugging and forced musical numbers grate on the nerves, turning Steve into a flabby, loud distraction instead of the everyman hero Minecraft fans **** visuals? A garish mishmash of CGI and real world actors that clash worse than a creeper in a flower biome. The charm of Minecraft's pixelated freedom is buried under a generic 'save the world' story that feels like it was ripped from a dozen better films none of which bothered to star a Jack Black who seems to think yelling and flailing is a substitute for depth. Super Mario knew how to balance nostalgia with heart; this just shovels Easter eggs and tired gags into a pit and calls it a day. It's not just terrible it's a betrayal of everything that makes Minecraft special, leaving you longing for the Mushroom Kingdom instead of this blockheaded bore.TLDR - Jack Black ruined this movie and he is a bloated slob who phoned it in."
"Apr 4, 2025","10","HaloBlues","Man. It's Minecraft. Me and my high school friends, from around ages 12 to 15, would play this together for hours every day after school, and I still to this day have so many fond memories. It's not a game that immediately comes to mind when I think about my all-time favourites, but after some consideration I believe it warrants a place on that list for its longevity, its sentimental value, how easy it is as a method of bringing people together, and how broad and full of possibilities it is as an avenue for almost any kind of world or game-within-a-game you can think of."

Everyone knows this game, it doesn't matter if your a grandma playing on her mobile device, a little kid playing on their crusty ipad or a hardcore gamer playing on a PC, everyone knows Minecraft. Minecraft is one of if not the most re-playable games ever made. It's also the best multiplayer game ever hands down. For those reasons combined with others like incredible progression, boss design and world generation mechanics make this the best game of all time. I don't understand how people can even argue that this isn't the best game of all time unless they haven't gotten a full experience with the game. There's no contest Minecraft is the best game ever made."

With its viral gameplay on YouTube and still being in the top spot after 14+ years, it just keeps improving. Having the creative liberty to do pretty much anything and I do mean ANYTHING! People have built from small farms to literal 1:1 city and even computers that work inside of Minecraft, there is no limit to what you can think of. The game offers amazing exploitation with its unique generative worlds and a base survival story which you don’t even need to complete to be honest to experience the best of the game. The updates are just icing on the cake with cool stuff coming out each year to make the game even better and more explorative. The Community keeps adding amazing mods and servers to experience the game is more than an"
